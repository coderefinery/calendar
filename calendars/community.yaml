  - summary: Community teaching workshop
    description: |
      It's dangerous to go alone, take each other!  Remote work has
      transformed interactive teaching from something that exists in
      one room to something that can be a community event.  While
      online misses physical presence, by using the practices
      CodeRefinery has developed, we can keep it reasonable interactive
      and take advantage of a huge number of other benefits, such as
      more collaboration, more ways to learn (for different needs), and
      more large-scale interaction.

      This mini-workshop will try to discuss (and demonstrate) some of
      the best practices that CodeRefinery (https://coderefinery.org)
      has learned during remote teaching, and provides a hands-on way
      of getting some experience with them.  At only three hours, this
      is more of a preview and discussion than an intensive training
      event (and we hope to have a longer event sometime in mid-late
      2022).

  - summary: Python for Scicomp Hackathon
    description: |
      Work together to improve the Python for Scicomp course materials.
      The winter 2022 Python for Scicomp is still fresh in our minds
      and the feedback is handy. It's easy to postpone implementing
      these to tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes and we end frantically
      updating materials a few weeks before the course.

      But this time it will be different! We will start with an informal
      chat and planning session on Zoom and continue to work on our
      favorite sections, or the sections we think need the most work.
      
      Everyone is welcome. You don't need have tought the course. If
      you have time to help with a few issues, your help is appreciated.
