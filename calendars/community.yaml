  - summary: Community teaching workshop
    description: |
      It's dangerous to go alone, take each other!  Remote work has
      transformed interactive teaching from something that exists in
      one room to something that can be a community event.  While
      online misses physical presence, by using the practices
      CodeRefinery has developed, we can keep it reasonable interactive
      and take advantage of a huge number of other benefits, such as
      more collaboration, more ways to learn (for different needs), and
      more large-scale interaction.

      This mini-workshop will try to discuss (and demonstrate) some of
      the best practices that CodeRefinery (https://coderefinery.org)
      has learned during remote teaching, and provides a hands-on way
      of getting some experience with them.  At only three hours, this
      is more of a preview and discussion than an intensive training
      event (and we hope to have a longer event sometime in mid-late
      2022).
