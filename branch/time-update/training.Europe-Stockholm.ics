DESCRIPTION:https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-
 summer-2022/\n\nDay 1:\n\n  This course is a general introduction to 
 computational\n  researchers. The point is to serve as a guide to your 
 career:\n  a map to the types of resources that are available and skills\n
   you may need in your career\, so that you can be prepared when\n  you 
 need more in the future. There will also be topics related\n  to using 
 these resources. Aalto University is used in some\n  examples\, but all 
 parts are designed to be useful no matter\n  where you are now.\n\n  This 
 course is especially suitable to new researchers or\n  students trying to 
 understand computational/data analysis\n  options available to them. It 
 won’t go into anything too deep\,\n  but will provide you with a good 
 background for your next\n  steps: you will know what resources are 
 available and know the\n  next steps to use them.\n\nDay 2-3:\n\n  
 Scientific Computing Kickstart is a three × half day course\n  for 
 researchers to get started with scientific computing (day\n  1) and high-
 performance computing (HPC) clusters (day 2). We\n  will take you from 
 being a new user to being competent to run\n  your code at a larger scale 
 than you could before. (However\,\n  we don’t cover application-specific 
 matters beyond some\n  Python/R/Matlab basics or focus on the high-
 performance part:\n  but this is an easy next step after this course).\n\n
   This course is good for any researcher who thinks they may\n  need to 
 scale up to larger resources in the next six months\,\n  in any field. 
 Even if you don’t use computing clusters\, you\n  will be better prepared 
 to understand how computing works on\n  other systems. If you are a 
 student\, this is an investment in\n  your skills. By the end of the 
 course you get the hints\, ready\n  solutions and copy/paste examples on 
 how to find\, run and\n  monitor your applications\, and manage your data.
  In addition\n  to how to optimize your workflow in terms of filesystem\n
   traffic\, memory usage etc.

SUMMARY:Linux Shell Scripting
UID:1bd6ea5e-f4c4-4268-9542-4cb632797b81@1bd6.org
DESCRIPTION:Did you know that SLURM batch script is a regular BASH shell 
 script mostly? Did you know that when you login to Triton (our computer 
 cluster) your terminal is a fully enabled shell scripting environment? Do 
 you want to know how to create an alias\, a function\, how to use loops 
 and traps in a shell\, work with variables and arrays? This course is 
 oriented on those who want to start using BASH programming fully and use 
 terminal efficiently.\nWe expect that course participants are familiar 
 with the shell basics (experience with BASH\, ZSH\, etc). We somewhat 
 touch the Part 1 of the Linux Shell tutorial\, and continue to Part 2. 
 Though we expect that participant knows how to create a directory and can 
 edit file from the linux shell command line. We will be scripting a lot\, 
 there will be lots of demos and real practicing.location: Online\,

SUMMARY:MPI introduction
UID:4d094d62-74d0-416e-8413-258a1cd9ac39@4d09.org
DESCRIPTION:In this introduction to MPI programming we are going to cover 
 all the basic functionalities of the API\,\nand see how these are applied 
 to real problems. Starting from simple\, well-established algorithms\, 
 we\nwill build up towards more advanced and realistic examples commonly 
 found in computational physics and\nchemistry. Finally\, we will explore 
 how the strengths of OpenMP multithreading and MPI can be combined\nwith 
 hybrid parallel programming.\nhttps://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/mpi-
