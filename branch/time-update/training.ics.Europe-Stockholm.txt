Description:

https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-summer-2022/

Day 1:

  This course is a general introduction to computational
  researchers. The point is to serve as a guide to your career:
  a map to the types of resources that are available and skills
  you may need in your career, so that you can be prepared when
  you need more in the future. There will also be topics related
  to using these resources. Aalto University is used in some
  examples, but all parts are designed to be useful no matter
  where you are now.

  This course is especially suitable to new researchers or
  students trying to understand computational/data analysis
  options available to them. It won’t go into anything too deep,
  but will provide you with a good background for your next
  steps: you will know what resources are available and know the
  next steps to use them.

Day 2-3:

  Scientific Computing Kickstart is a three × half day course
  for researchers to get started with scientific computing (day
  1) and high-performance computing (HPC) clusters (day 2). We
  will take you from being a new user to being competent to run
  your code at a larger scale than you could before. (However,
  we don’t cover application-specific matters beyond some
  Python/R/Matlab basics or focus on the high-performance part:
  but this is an easy next step after this course).

  This course is good for any researcher who thinks they may
  need to scale up to larger resources in the next six months,
  in any field. Even if you don’t use computing clusters, you
  will be better prepared to understand how computing works on
  other systems. If you are a student, this is an investment in
  your skills. By the end of the course you get the hints, ready
  solutions and copy/paste examples on how to find, run and
  monitor your applications, and manage your data. In addition
  to how to optimize your workflow in terms of filesystem
  traffic, memory usage etc.

Did you know that SLURM batch script is a regular BASH shell script mostly? Did you know that when you login to Triton (our computer cluster) your terminal is a fully enabled shell scripting environment? Do you want to know how to create an alias, a function, how to use loops and traps in a shell, work with variables and arrays? This course is oriented on those who want to start using BASH programming fully and use terminal efficiently.
We expect that course participants are familiar with the shell basics (experience with BASH, ZSH, etc). We somewhat touch the Part 1 of the Linux Shell tutorial, and continue to Part 2. Though we expect that participant knows how to create a directory and can edit file from the linux shell command line. We will be scripting a lot, there will be lots of demos and real practicing.location: Online, register for connection details

In this introduction to MPI programming we are going to cover all the basic functionalities of the API,
and see how these are applied to real problems. Starting from simple, well-established algorithms, we
will build up towards more advanced and realistic examples commonly found in computational physics and
chemistry. Finally, we will explore how the strengths of OpenMP multithreading and MPI can be combined
with hybrid parallel programming.
